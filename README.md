## Game Mechanics

### Player Movement

	•	The player can move left and right using the arrow keys.
	•	The player cannot move beyond the screen boundaries.

### Catnip Movement

	•	Catnips fall from the top of the screen at a constant speed.
	•	When an catnip hits the floor, it is removed, a new catnip is spawned at the top, and the player loses a heart.
	•	When an catnip is caught by the player, it is removed, a new catnip is spawned at the top, the speed of the catnips increases slightly, and the player’s score increases by one.

### Hearts

	•	The player starts with 5 hearts.
	•	A heart is removed each time an catnip hits the floor.
	•	The game prints “Game Over” and stops when all hearts are lost.
